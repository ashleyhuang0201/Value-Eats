Instructions on how to run the frontend locally:
 - Firstly, make sure yarn is installed, to do this, follow this guide: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable
 - It will direct you to this download nodejs from this site (https://nodejs.org/en/) and ask you to complete the installation through npm, which comes with node.
 - From there, you should be able to run the command `npm install --global yarn`
 - Now that yarn is installed, clone the repo and run `yarn install` in the frontend folder
 - This will install the frontend dependencies
 - Then finally, to run the frontend, use `yarn start`
 - NOTE: When committing, DO NOT commit the node_modules folder that will be created locally for our dependencies, as they are very large files and will cause issues if uploaded to our repo
