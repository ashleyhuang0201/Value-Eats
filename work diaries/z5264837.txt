        - Proposal: Technical Depth, Scale, Reporting Format
            - Discussed about what were planning to use
            - We are planning to leverage Java's SpringBoot, React and SQLite
    - What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
        - SQLite vs AWS RDS
            - Discussed about the advantages and disadvantages of both
            - SQLite could provide faster iterations by its ease of use such as deleting the database or updating the schema
            - Postgres could allow a centralised data pool so we could replicate test data
            - In the end, we chose SQLite as it was simpler to develop with, and we did not have to overengineer with AWS' potentially billable service
    - What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
        - No issues as we achieved more than expected
    - What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)

        - Sprint #1
            - Potential to start on the authentication sprint

        - Starting sprint 1
            - We planned to commence work on the project in advance to help us further understand the specifications and hence the proposal
            - We were unable to commence work as we were focused on improving the quality of the proposal directly rather than indirectly through development
            - This will not impact our overall project progress as this was an extension goal which we would have liked to achieve in order to reduce future workload
    - What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
        - As it is the start of a project, there will be a lot of setting up of both environments and machines
        - Sprint 1
