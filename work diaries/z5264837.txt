            - Discussed about what were planning to use
            - We are planning to leverage Java's SpringBoot, React and SQLite
    - What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
        - SQLite vs AWS RDS
            - Discussed about the advantages and disadvantages of both
            - SQLite could provide faster iterations by its ease of use such as deleting the database or updating the schema
            - Postgres could allow a centralised data pool so we could replicate test data
            - In the end, we chose SQLite as it was simpler to develop with, and we did not have to overengineer with AWS' potentially billable service
    - What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered

            - Required drawing out potential issues within the given scope
    - What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
        - Starting sprint 1
            - We planned to commence work on the project in advance to help us further understand the specifications and hence the proposal
            - We were unable to commence work as we were focused on improving the quality of the proposal directly rather than indirectly through development
            - This will not impact our overall project progress as this was an extension goal which we would have liked to achieve in order to reduce future workload
    - What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
        - As it is the start of a project, there will be a lot of setting up of both environments and machines
        - Sprint 1

        - Scalability vs Fit For Purpose
            - Tokens: Many Tokens vs One Token Per User
                - Chosen Design: One token per user as it was simpler
                - Does not properly allow multiple sessions per user
                    - Token is deactivated once a user logouts
                    - Previous token is deactivated once a user logs in
            - User Id Generation: Race Condition
                - Chosen Design: To ignore as we do not have a massive userbase
                - Does not allow multiple users to safely register at the same time
        - Lack of specification
            - Differing ideas on
                - Database design
                - Object oriented programming
                - API design
            - Caused issues as changes were made half way through which caused other edits to be required
            - Through discussion and better planning, especially in the future we can avoid this issue
        - Branching
            - Base branch become a feature branch
            - Caused issues as a lot of changes were occuring which created conflicts
            - We ended up merging core templates into master so we could have the template built
    - What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
        - Sprint 1 was not finished
            - A lot of differing ideas of how to do a specific task, especially as it was the start where there was a lot of core development
            - This is a small set back and we are able to catchup after finalising our core discussions, especially as the workload was purposefully small
            - We will complete the remaining tickets before the lab to ensure we meet client deadlines
            - Last sprint's tickets will be done in addition to the next sprint's planned goal
    - What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
        - Sprint 2
            - Development of profiles and their associated management
        - Last week's remaining tasks

        - Successfully finished draft of retrospective
            - Discussed about our good, bad and neutrals
            - Agreed to improve on the given to trys along with an owner who will take responsibility such as branch naming and api design documentation
    - What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
        - This sprint was able to move a lot more smoother after we were able to enforce better workflow such as less overlap and discussions before implementation
        - We did address some tech debt and some bad design practices which were used in previous iterations by further educating ourselves on what tools are at our disposals and standard methodologies
    - What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
        - This week was our heaviest workload week in terms of the project's plan
        - We were able to successfully complete most of the work except the update eatery front end and although we were unable to completely finish it, it was a good that we were able to finish most considering the load
        - As this is a relatively small feature which was primarily overlooked and forgotten by accident, we are able to come back from this early in the sprint
    - What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
        - Sprint 3: Voucher management
        - Further finalise the retrospective
        - Tech Debt
            - Although from a feature standpoint we are meeting goals, we are definitely able to improve the code quality of our project
            - We should try to improve readability and reduce reptitiveness

Week 6
    - What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
        - Sprint 3: Voucher management
        - Further finalise the retrospective
        - Tech Debt
            - Although from a feature standpoint we are meeting goals, we are definitely able to improve the code quality of our project
            - We should try to improve readability and reduce reptitiveness
    - What was finished
        - Finished sprint 3 which focused on vouchers such as their distribution and creation
        - Created the foundations of how the voucher schema would work with one off and weekly vouchers
        - Good UI/UX developments on the front end where it looks significantly more appealing
        - The backend was ahead so we decided to accelerate into next sprint so that we can have more time to finialise the project near the end of term
    - What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
        - Edge Cases
            - There were a lot of edges cases considering the vouchers implementations which we did not initially consider
                - For example, the voucher distribution could not be distributed starting at any date in the future
                - As this is also a calendar problem, we had to manage timezone issues and efficient ways of creating new vouchers from repeating vouchers
                    - In the end, we utilised a scheduler which would clean up the database at set times during the day
        - Broken Master
            - Master was broken due to different machines having different settings
            - This was addressed by finding the solution to the problem on the internet and raising a PR to fix the issue
    - What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered
        - Everything that was planned was finished on time
        - We could also improve the quality of the code some more but that will be an ongoing motif of the project
    - What is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)
        - Further address tech debt as there has been a focus on feature implementation
            - Improve code design
            - Use functions instead of repeating
        - UI/UX
            - Continue polishing off the front end and make it look good overall
        - Submit the retrospective along with any final adjustments
        - General nice to have features
            - More error checks
            - Better error messages
