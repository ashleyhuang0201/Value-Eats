Week 1
- The group was formed + JIRA, google doc and github repo were set up 
- Contributed to the background research in the drawbacks of existing work that our application will aim to offer on the google doc
- I did the initial storyboarding for the user (diner) side of the interface e.g. User Profile, Eatery Profile, SignUp/Login
- One of the issues we ran into was that initially our storyboard wireframes were set in a 1:1 aspect ratio. We changed the size of a lot of wireframes to closely represent a 16:9 aspect ratio and adjusted the UI elements to fit in order to have a more realistic indication of our UI on a browser. 
- Assisted in making changes to the storyboard to make UI fixes on Sunday night with the rest of the group 

Future:
- I plan to put together the storyboard to show the flow of the wireframes in the coming weeks. 
- As a team, we plan to have user stories completed by next week Saturday and discuss it on the same day at 5pm.

Week 2
- I set up draw.io for our storyboard and did an initial draft of connecting the wireframes. As a team, we reviewed the wireframes and noted that we were missing some critical components such as an email address login for eateries. We continued to make minor fixes and changes to the storyboard.
- After completing our user stories, we decided to move it into JIRA. We added user stories, their corresponding acceptance criteria and story points under epics. We made some adjustments to our user stories as we realised that some stories were more suited to belong under other epics. We were also able to become more familiar with the interface. 
- We also decided what user stories we wanted to accomplish by our upcoming Wednesday lab so we can make progress on the technical side of the project
- Discussed system architecture and what technologies/languages we are planning to use in more depth
- We chose SQLite due to its simplicity over PostgreSQL

Future:
- I plan to finalise the storyboard and the proposal before this week's upcoming lab
- If there is additional time, I plan to start on the frontend

Week 3
- Our goal was to finish the entire proposal and finalise it for submission.
- We were able to successfully complete our goal and submit our proposal
- Over the past week, I worked on various components of our proposal such as finalising the storyboard, writing a description for the presentation layer of the system architecture, mapping etc. 
- As a team, we all ensured that our proposal looked presentable and checked through it to ensure that we met the marking criteria 
- Obstacles that we faced:
    - Splitting our user stories up into epics
        - We initially had a mix of "As a eatery owner" and "As a diner" within the user management epic
        - After discussion, we were able to come to a final decision of splitting the eatery side of the interface into an epic and diner side into another epic
        - User stories for both were written as "As a user" such as login/logout and remained in the user management epic
- What was not finished:
    - Everything was finished within the proposal and we were all satisfied with it
    - However, We have not made a start on our first sprint. We intend to this beginning on Monday. 
- What is planned for the next period:
    - I plan to focus more on the frontend of our authentication features
    - We plan to implement the user stories we have placed in our first sprint which are mainly authentication features
    - If there is additional time, we will implement more features

Week 4
- What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - setup the frontend, backend and database
    - complete Sprint 1 (authentication) by the end of this week which included login, register and logout 

- What we finished:
    - database created, login/registerDiner/registerEatery/logout completed
    - I worked mainly on the frontend pages such as registerDiner and registerEatery - general form, checking that fields are valid + error messages, routing
    - I also made a helpers file to reduce code repetition + made some styled components 
    - We were able to successfully connect the frontend to the backend, make requests and pass data into the database

- Obstacles that we faced:
    - In terms of backend, there were some disparities in opinions on system design due to a lack of consistency. 
    - Creating branches too early on when the backend was not completely set up properly caused issues with merging
    - There was also some confusion in terms of the type of data the frontend was passing to the backend, which was resolved by discussion and could be avoided in the future through communication. 
    - Branching became slightly chaotic and we had different versions on different branches, which we could work to improve on in the next few sprints

- What was not finished:
    - localstorage of token at the frontend, adding the feature of eateries being allowed to upload photos at registration of their food (plan to finish it off on Monday)

- What is planned for the next period:
    - make a start on sprint 2 which includes creating the eatery profile, diner profile and reviews 
    - refactor code if necessary

Week 5
- What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - complete Sprint 2 by the end of the week which encompassed adding reviews, ratings, editing and deleting reviews, showing reviews on the profile page and an eatery viewing their own profile

- What we finished:
    - Sprint 2 was finished by the end of the week
    - This sprint, I worked on frontend per usual. I worked on the diner landing page which displays all eateries and recommended eateries. The recommended eateries have not been implemented yet but currently the placeholders are just a list of eateries, which will be replaced in the future sprints.
    - I also worked on the profile of the eatery ( from a diners perspective and an eatery owners perspective ) to display its details and reviews + placeholders for vouchers in the next sprint
    - Creating, deleting, editing reviews + diner profile were completed by Ben on the frontend
    - Backend was completed by my other teammates
    - cleaned up branches from sprint 1

- Obstacles that we faced:
    - There were no major obstacles faced
    - initally passed token around through props, changed it to useContext + localStorage after considering persistency and ease of use without needing to pass a token prop everytime

- What was not finished:
    - update eatery profile was not finished so it will be moved to the next sprint 
    - the UI still looks a bit rough but hoping to improve it in the coming week

- What is planned for the next period:
    - Start and complete Sprint 3 which mainly focuses upon eatery providing vouchers
    - Work on the UI, starting from Login screen
    - refactor code + test
