Week 1
- The group was formed + JIRA, google doc and github repo were set up 
- Contributed to the background research in the drawbacks of existing work that our application will aim to offer on the google doc
- I did the initial storyboarding for the user (diner) side of the interface e.g. User Profile, Eatery Profile, SignUp/Login
- One of the issues we ran into was that initially our storyboard wireframes were set in a 1:1 aspect ratio. We changed the size of a lot of wireframes to closely represent a 16:9 aspect ratio and adjusted the UI elements to fit in order to have a more realistic indication of our UI on a browser. 
- Assisted in making changes to the storyboard to make UI fixes on Sunday night with the rest of the group 

Future:
- I plan to put together the storyboard to show the flow of the wireframes in the coming weeks. 
- As a team, we plan to have user stories completed by next week Saturday and discuss it on the same day at 5pm.

Week 2
- I set up draw.io for our storyboard and did an initial draft of connecting the wireframes. As a team, we reviewed the wireframes and noted that we were missing some critical components such as an email address login for eateries. We continued to make minor fixes and changes to the storyboard.
- After completing our user stories, we decided to move it into JIRA. We added user stories, their corresponding acceptance criteria and story points under epics. We made some adjustments to our user stories as we realised that some stories were more suited to belong under other epics. We were also able to become more familiar with the interface. 
- We also decided what user stories we wanted to accomplish by our upcoming Wednesday lab so we can make progress on the technical side of the project
- Discussed system architecture and what technologies/languages we are planning to use in more depth
- We chose SQLite due to its simplicity over PostgreSQL

Future:
- I plan to finalise the storyboard and the proposal before this week's upcoming lab
- If there is additional time, I plan to start on the frontend

Week 3
- Our goal was to finish the entire proposal and finalise it for submission.
- We were able to successfully complete our goal and submit our proposal
- Over the past week, I worked on various components of our proposal such as finalising the storyboard, writing a description for the presentation layer of the system architecture, mapping etc. 
- As a team, we all ensured that our proposal looked presentable and checked through it to ensure that we met the marking criteria 
- Obstacles that we faced:
    - Splitting our user stories up into epics
        - We initially had a mix of "As a eatery owner" and "As a diner" within the user management epic
        - After discussion, we were able to come to a final decision of splitting the eatery side of the interface into an epic and diner side into another epic
        - User stories for both were written as "As a user" such as login/logout and remained in the user management epic
- What was not finished:
    - Everything was finished within the proposal and we were all satisfied with it
    - However, We have not made a start on our first sprint. We intend to this beginning on Monday. 
- What is planned for the next period:
    - I plan to focus more on the frontend of our authentication features
    - We plan to implement the user stories we have placed in our first sprint which are mainly authentication features
    - If there is additional time, we will implement more features

Week 4
- What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - setup the frontend, backend and database
    - complete Sprint 1 (authentication) by the end of this week which included login, register and logout 

- What we finished:
    - database created, login/registerDiner/registerEatery/logout completed
    - I worked mainly on the frontend pages such as registerDiner and registerEatery - general form, checking that fields are valid + error messages, routing
    - I also made a helpers file to reduce code repetition + made some styled components 
    - We were able to successfully connect the frontend to the backend, make requests and pass data into the database

- Obstacles that we faced:
    - In terms of backend, there were some disparities in opinions on system design due to a lack of consistency. 
    - Creating branches too early on when the backend was not completely set up properly caused issues with merging
    - There was also some confusion in terms of the type of data the frontend was passing to the backend, which was resolved by discussion and could be avoided in the future through communication. 
    - Branching became slightly chaotic and we had different versions on different branches, which we could work to improve on in the next few sprints

- What was not finished:
    - localstorage of token at the frontend, adding the feature of eateries being allowed to upload photos at registration of their food (plan to finish it off on Monday)

- What is planned for the next period:
    - make a start on sprint 2 which includes creating the eatery profile, diner profile and reviews 
    - refactor code if necessary

Week 5
- What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - complete Sprint 2 by the end of the week which encompassed adding reviews, ratings, editing and deleting reviews, showing reviews on the profile page and an eatery viewing their own profile

- What we finished:
    - Sprint 2 was finished by the end of the week
    - This sprint, I worked on frontend per usual. I worked on the diner landing page which displays all eateries and recommended eateries. The recommended eateries have not been implemented yet but currently the placeholders are just a list of eateries, which will be replaced in the future sprints.
    - I also worked on the profile of the eatery ( from a diners perspective and an eatery owners perspective ) to display its details and reviews + placeholders for vouchers in the next sprint
    - Creating, deleting, editing reviews + diner profile were completed by Ben on the frontend
    - Backend was completed by my other teammates
    - cleaned up branches from sprint 1

- Obstacles that we faced:
    - There were no major obstacles faced
    - initally passed token around through props, changed it to useContext + localStorage after considering persistency and ease of use without needing to pass a token prop everytime

- What was not finished:
    - update eatery profile was not finished so it will be moved to the next sprint 
    - the UI still looks a bit rough but hoping to improve it in the coming week

- What is planned for the next period:
    - Start and complete Sprint 3 which mainly focuses upon eatery providing vouchers
    - Work on the UI, starting from Login screen
    - refactor code + test 


Week 6
- What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - The plan was to complete sprint 3 and continue to work on the UI which was successfully completed

- What we finished:
    - Both sprint 3 (eatery voucher distribution) and sprint 4 (user voucher acceptance) were finished this week 
    - I also finished off updating eatery profile details (allowing eateries to edit their profile) which was not finished in the previous sprint 
    - This week I mainly worked on setting up frontend to display the user side of vouchers. This encompasses diners being able to see a voucher on an eatery profile, book a voucher and display all their vouchers, both past and present with appropriate time stamps. 
    - I also worked on designing the login page with visual elements that reflect our project
    - Backend was implemented by my other teammates and Ben implemented the frontend of the eatery side of vouchers. 
    - started making repetitive code into components (overlap of register eatery form and eatery update form)

- Obstacles that we faced:
    - There were design complications in the backend in regards to the best way to provide vouchers for recurring voucher which was resolved by changing the initial implementation.
    - Occasionally, frontend required more details from the backend endpoints, but this was easily resolved and swiftly handled by communciating the changes that needed to be made.

- What was not finished:
    - set up polling for vouchers
    - error message from the frontend if backend has not been started 

- What is planned for the next period:
    - As both sprints are completed earlier than expected, we plan to make a start on sprint 5 
    - I plan to continue to improve the UI as well as set up polling
    - continue to refactor frontend


Week 7
- What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - The plan was to finish off the basic functionalities for sprint 4 user stories
    - improve the UI, continue to refactor

- What we finished:
    - Sprint 4 was successfully completed this week although most of it was completed in the previous week
    - We made some basic UI design changes, Ben added confetti :D, improved responsiveness which will continue to be improved on in future sprints
    - cleaned up some code on the frontend, made styled components to reduce repetition, allow ease of use and change + consistency
    - Made a temporary logo for value eats
    - Teammates in the backend made a start on sprint 5 in terms of implementing search and tests

- Obstacles that we faced:
    - No major obstacles were faced 
    - required small change from backend to allow for deletion of weekly vouchers made by eateries, was easily resolved by adding an extra field

- What was not finished:
    - I made the overall frontend look too orange in my opinion - unfinished overall design, could increase contrast of colours

- What is planned for the next period:
    - Implement search for a restaurant based on various factors and recommendation algorithm
    - Continue to fix up UI design + responsiveness + accessibility

Week 8
- What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - The completion of Sprint 5 was planned for this week which focused upon the Recommendation algorithm and sorting eateries based upon ratings, distance and new.
    - Continual improvements to the UI design 
    - Conduct testing

- What we finished:
    - Sprint 5 was successfully completed  and users are able to be provided with recommendations of restaurants that they have not been too, as well as sort the eateries.
    - Frontend wise, most of the code was already set up so it was easily integrated with the backend.
    - I added a search page to display results, registering users and eateries with respective profile pictures/banners and sorting on the frontend
    - I also worked on improving the visual design, still a work in progress 
    - Tests were added for both the frontend and backend, also still a work in progress  
    - We also completed our retrospective shortly after our demonstration, discussing things that worked out well from the last retrospective, as well as things that we could potentially improve on in the future

- Obstacles that we faced:
    - The main issue this sprint was on backend implementation of sorting eateries by distance from the diner which was resolved through experimentation of the distance matrix. 
    - At the frontend, the diner's location is requested for and if granted permissions, their geolocation coordations (longitutde, latitude) would be provided to the backend and compared with the location of the eateries.

- What was not finished:
    - The functionalities have all been completed, however, the visual design could definitely be further improved. 

- What is planned for the next period:
    - As the project will be due rather soon, we will need to finalise everything in terms of code quality, visual design, testing etc.
    - We also will need to begin our final report and hopefully get it finalised by the end of the week 

Week 9
- What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - The plan was to completely finish our project, including the report and documentation, as well as testing. 
    - Clean up our code and make improvements where possible

- What we finished:
    - We were able to successfully finish our project with all the functionalities that we intended to implement completed
    - I worked on redesigning the frontend as it was initally very plain, added in some visual design
    - I also worked on making fixes to various elements such as defaulting the time of vouchers when selecting to the be current time to make it more usable for users

- Obstacles that we faced:
    - The main obstacle that we faced in this sprint was time. 
    - As it is coming towards the end of the term, everyone tends to become busier and are more pressed for time with deadlines from other courses as well
    - However, despite this, we were able to resolve this by working on it whenever we had the free time as well as helping each other out if one person was more available

- What was not finished:
    - Everything was completed including the report and the project

- What is planned for the next period:
    - Prepare for the demonstration
