Week 1
- The group was formed + JIRA, google doc and github repo were set up 
- Contributed to the background research in the drawbacks of existing work that our application will aim to offer on the google doc
- I did the initial storyboarding for the user (diner) side of the interface e.g. User Profile, Eatery Profile, SignUp/Login
- One of the issues we ran into was that initially our storyboard wireframes were set in a 1:1 aspect ratio. We changed the size of a lot of wireframes to closely represent a 16:9 aspect ratio and adjusted the UI elements to fit in order to have a more realistic indication of our UI on a browser. 
- Assisted in making changes to the storyboard to make UI fixes on Sunday night with the rest of the group 

Future:
- I plan to put together the storyboard to show the flow of the wireframes in the coming weeks. 
- As a team, we plan to have user stories completed by next week Saturday and discuss it on the same day at 5pm.

Week 2
- I set up draw.io for our storyboard and did an initial draft of connecting the wireframes. As a team, we reviewed the wireframes and noted that we were missing some critical components such as an email address login for eateries. We continued to make minor fixes and changes to the storyboard.
- After completing our user stories, we decided to move it into JIRA. We added user stories, their corresponding acceptance criteria and story points under epics. We made some adjustments to our user stories as we realised that some stories were more suited to belong under other epics. We were also able to become more familiar with the interface. 
- We also decided what user stories we wanted to accomplish by our upcoming Wednesday lab so we can make progress on the technical side of the project
- Discussed system architecture and what technologies/languages we are planning to use in more depth
- We chose SQLite due to its simplicity over PostgreSQL

Future:
- I plan to finalise the storyboard and the proposal before this week's upcoming lab
- If there is additional time, I plan to start on the frontend
