      background, user stories and sprints, Technical Depth, Scale, Reporting Format.
    - I helped finalize the background and added the basic structure for the user interface.
    
  What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
    - We discussed about our process and improved the proposal background.
    We also improved the design of the user interface demo in the Balsamiq.

  What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
  progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
  not endangered:
    - User stories are not finished because we need to understand the software better.
    - We are planning to add more details to the user stories.
  
  What is planned for the next period:
    - We will continue working on the user stories and discuss the techniques we are going to use.

Week2:
  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
  - We should finalise the proposal and the user stories.

  What was finished:
    - We discussed the system architecture and created the initial system architecture diagram.
    - We will use Spring Boot, React, SQLite for frontend and backend.
    - We choose SQLite because it is simple to use and we are familar with it.
    - I helped finalising the user stories and added them to the epics on Jira, I also assigned story points to each user story
      and 1 story point is 2 hours of work.
    - I created some new user stories in the proposal added details to them, I also added them to the epics on Jira.
  
  What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
    - We need to construct the system archtecture diagram, we use draw.io to create the dirgram and share it throught google drive.
  
    What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
    progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
    not endangered:
    
    - No issue and we finished most of the stuff.

    - I will finalise the proposal before this week's lab.
    - I will work on backend and implement an entity if there is additional time.

Week3:
  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - Finalise the proposal before this week's lab, work on backend and implement an entity if there is additional time.

  What was finished:
    - Some user stories and epics are not correctly related to the storyboards diagram, I helped fixing them up and rewriting the description for them,
      I also checked their storyboard ID are correctly attached to the correct user stories.
    - We created a table for Project Feature Objectives and their corresponding User Stories
    - I helped creating the table for referencing storyboard Id and corresponding user stories in Jira.
    - I helped creating the system architecture diagram, I added the descriptions for the technologies we are using.
  
    What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
    - We need to construct the storyboard diagrams and the system archtecture diagram, we use draw.io to create the dirgram and added to the proposal

Week4:
  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - Work on the 1st sprint next week, set up the backend and implement the functions for user stories.

  What was finished:
    - We have mostly finished the register and login features in the backend.
    - We have connected the frontend to the backend, and make rest calls to the backend.
    - I have set up the configuration files for spring boot in the backend and connected it to the sqlite3 database.
    - I have implemented the sql tables to store the user data and token.
    - I have implemented the entity, controller, service, repository for the user to register and login.
  
    What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
    - There were some conflicts in the data structure and data types, lack of ER relationship design in the sql.
    - There were too many (12) sql tables in the database, I have reduced it to 3 so that it will be easier to maintenance.
  
    What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
    progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
    not endangered:
    
    - The token is not currently working, we need to store the token into database when a user login.
    
  What is planned for the next period:
    - I will discuss the token feature and sql tables with my teammates, I will also work on the sprint2 in backend.
    
Week5:
  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - Discuss the token feature and sql tables with my teammates, work on the sprint2 in backend.

  What was finished:
    - We have finished the functionality for reviews and update profiles.
    - I have set up the entity, controller, service and repository for user reviews and link them to the databases.
    - I have implemented the create review, list reviews methods and link them to the database.
    - I have implemented the update diner profile method which take the token and the updated diner information as input.
    - I have implemented the profile picture methods for diner which allow them to upload a picture and save it in the database.
    - I have implemented the update eatery profile method which takes the token and the updated eatery information as input.
    - I have implemented cuisines and menu photos for diners, which allows the eatery to update and store them in the database.
  
    What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
    - We need to pass the user information and token as a JSONobject to the backend, which is challenge for backend to interpret it.
    - We choose to use JSONString to pass them.
  
    What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
    progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
    not endangered:
    
    - Everything is finished, I am going to work in sprint3.

    - I will work on the voucher create, voucher create and voucher edit.

Week6:
  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - We were planning to finish the voucher feature and booking voucher featuers.
    - We were planning to improve the update profile method.

  What was finished:
    - We have finished most of the voucher features.
    - The vouchers are consist of repeated vouchers and one-off vouchers.
    - We have finished the booking voucher feature and set its duration.
    - I have implemented the feature to create a repeated voucher and a one-off voucher.
    - I have implemented the feature to list all vouchers as an eatery or a diner.
    - I have implemented the feature to make a booking and set its duration for a diner.

  
    What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
  
    - The sql relationship between voucher, repeated voucher and one-off voucher was complex, so we improved the data sturcture.
    - Difficult to implement the data and duration features, so we decided to define some enumerable variables for them.
    - Difficult to test and verify the vouchers, because they have different code, date, duration. We implemented some
      helper functions to check them.
  
    What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
    progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
    not endangered:
    
    - All stuffs in the backend are done.
    
  What is planned for the next period:
    - I will continue working on the backend, finish the other features for vouchers and implement the search algorithms.

Week7:
  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - We planned to finish the other features for vouchers.
    - We planned to start implementing the search algorithms.

  What was finished:
    - We have finished all of the voucher features, sprint 4 is successfully completed
    - The one off vouchers and repeated vouchers are in seperate sql tables.

    - I have finished implementing all features for the vouchers.
    - I have created some tests to test all functionalities and some edge cases.
    - We also improved backend structure, and created seperate function to verify the token.
    
  What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
    - The backend structure is a little messy, there are some redundant functions. We cleaned them up, combined some functions
      and created the verify function for the token.
    - As we have different acceptance criterias and the functions are complex, I have implemented some tests for them especially
      some edge cases.

  What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
  progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
    not endangered:
    
    - All stuffs in the backend are done, we have finished sprint 4.
    
  What is planned for the next period:
    - I will implement more tests and write them in JUint. I will also implement the search and recommend algorithms for the diner and eatery.

Week8:
  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
    - We planned to implement more tests and write them in JUint.
    - We planned to implement the search and recommend algorithms for the diner and eatery.

  What was finished:

      create/update/verify one-off and repeated vouchers.
    
  What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
    - The obstacles is the JUint test does not accept passing object to the controller directly.
    - I overcame it by creating a Mocmvc and pass the object through a rest call to the controller.

  What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
  progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
    not endangered:
    
    - All stuffs in the backend are finished, we completed everything in sprint 5.
