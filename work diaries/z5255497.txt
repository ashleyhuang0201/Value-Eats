  What was finished:
    - We have formed group, setted up the github repository and Jira.
    - We had a meeting in the tutorial, we discussed the project and 
    started writing the proposal and creating the user interface demo.
    - We have set the proposal in the google document, we are going to finish table of contents,
      background, user stories and sprints, Technical Depth, Scale, Reporting Format.
    - I helped finalize the background and added the basic structure for the user interface.
    
  What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
    - We discussed about our process and improved the proposal background.
    We also improved the design of the user interface demo in the Balsamiq.

  What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
  progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
  not endangered:
    - User stories are not finished because we need to understand the software better.
    - We are planning to add more details to the user stories.
  
  What is planned for the next period:
    - We will continue working on the user stories and discuss the techniques we are going to use.

Week2:
  What was planned for the period since the last work diary entry:
  - We should finalise the proposal and the user stories.

  What was finished:
  - We discussed the system architecture and created the initial system architecture diagram.
  - We will use Spring Boot, React, SQLite for frontend and backend.
  - We choose SQLite because it is simple to use and we are familar with it.
  - We finialised the user stories and added them to the epics on Jira, we also assigned story points to each user story
    and 1 story point is 2 hours of work.
  - I created some new user stories in the proposal added details to them, I also added them to the epics on Jira.
  
    What were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
  overcome:
    - We need to construct the system archtecture diagram, we use draw.io to create the dirgram and share it throught google drive.
  
    What was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
    progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is
    not endangered:
    
    - No issue and we finished most of the stuff.
