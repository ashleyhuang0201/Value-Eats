Week 1
 - Formed our group, set up our team JIRA, google doc and github repository with the team.
 - Writing up an initial draft for the background of our project, identifying the problems our app is 
   aiming to resolve as well as conducting market research into the flaws that other competitors in the 
   same industry with their applications so we can be ensuring people want to make use of our software over competitors.
 - Furthermore, I helped with finalising the storyboards, changing the UI elements in a few places to make the 
   application flow, feel intuitive and adhere to standard UI/UX principles. Specifically, made the deletion of 
   eatery discounts more intuitive and informed that the user confirms upon clicking the button which performs the action, as it is an important action. Also added the screen which shows the user their code after they have booked in a discount code. The screen includes both the discount code and the amount of time that they have left to use it.
 - Met up with the group on Sunday night to finalise the story boards and check in on everyone’s progress, 
   as well as discussing the plans for the upcoming week.

Week 2
 - This week our groups focus was primarily on user stories 
 - I set up the initial drafts for our epics and confirmed that everyone was okay with them in the tutorial. From there, we could then categorize the user stories that other people had made
 into the correct epic category
 - I helped add in some additional user stories for some of the elements in our application that were initially missed, such as the stories for users personal voucher viewing
 - As I wrote user stories, in some cases, it required a minor reshift of the way our storyboards were structured. If this was the case, the changes were also reflected.
 - Also wrote up acceptance criteria for all of our user stories so the specific details of what needs to be accomplished from each particular story is clear.
 - After this, we met on Sunday at 5pm as a group in order to transfer our user stories to JIRA and work out which of those stories would be completed in the first sprint.
 We discussed this as a team as we will be using JIRA extensively throughout the rest of the project, so it is important for everyone to know where everything is.
 - I also made sure that we put some protocols in place for dealing with code, for example, when implementing a feature, we will write it on it's own feature branch, which will be
 merged back into the master branch once it has been finished with a pull request, which will have to be reviewed by a certain number of people on the team (probably only 1), before it is approved to 
 go back into master.
 - The other main item that I worked on this week was the initial construction of the system architecture diagram. On the meeting on Sunday that went from 5pm - 8pm, 
 I created a draft for our system architecture diagram, adding in images and connections between the components. For our frontend and backend, we will be using 
 Java SpringBoot and React as these are the technologies that we as a team are most familiar with.
 - Next week, I plan to finalise the proposal and format it nicely so it is ready for submission. We will meet on Wednesday and potentially more throughout the week to ensure that 
 everything is done to the highest standard.

Week 3
 - This week, we mainly were polishing all aspects of our report so get it ready for submitting on Sunday night.
 - Throughout the week, I finished refining the user stories to ensure the epics were general enough to classify all the user stories attached correctly. I also added a second system architecture diagram which is more
 focused on the specific entities that will need to be implemented for our solution, not just the technologies. Furthermore, I also assisted with cleaning up the proposal document to make
 remove some of the unnecessary paragraphs as well as refining some of the wording used throughout.
 - Next week, we will begin work on the first sprint, were we will aim to set up authentication. We will have a team meeting to work out how to divide the work amongst our group so we
 can work as efficiently as possible.

Week 4
 - Focused on completing our first sprint - which ends Sunday 27/6/2021 11:30. 
 - I made the initial frontend draft of what our login page was going to look like and this allowed for other team members to follow along using the same visual style
 - Furthermore, I connected the backend that was written to register and log in diners to the frontend
 - I had some issues with getting CORS to work, but it turned out to be a simple one-line command that was annotated on the authentication controller
 - Set up the method in which our backend will return information with a response backend service, which will ensure that responses are returned with a HTTP response code along
 with a message describing what happened and optionally some corresponding data.
 - Also set up the method in which our frontend will display information to users. It uses material UI components called snack bars, which are brief closable messages that appear
 at the bottom of the screen and will automatically disappear after a set amount of time.
 - Furthermore, I constructued the frontend for our landing pages making use of a component for a nav bar that Oscar had previously made. Then I connected the frontend to the backend logic
 to finish the logout feature, after making some backend changes to parts that were not working.

Week 5
What was planned for the period since the last work diary
 - Our plan since the period were to complete the diner functionality portion of the program, allowing diners to 
interact with restaurants, write reviews for them, edit and delete their own reviews as well as update their profiles.

What was finished
 - We successfully completed the sprint within the allocated timeframe. This involved completion of both the frontend 
and backend for all of the features described. This sprint, the frontend was a lot of work than the backend, as opposed 
to last time where the opposite was true. The fontend creation involved the styling and integration of 3 brand new pages. 
I focused primarily on the frontend, specifically handling the creation, editing and deletion of reviews as well as allowing 
the diner to update their profile.

What were the main technical and non technical obstacles and how they were overcome
 - This sprint went a lot smoother than the previous, and this was as a result of two factors. After the demonstration, we conducted our retrospective where 
 we discussed what we could do to improve our workflow. Whilst many useful things came from this such as the importance of good branch naming conventions the 
 most important one that increased the speed of workflow was the separation of tasks such that they did not overlap and working with not against each others code. 
 As a result, we did a lot less refactoring and consciously tried to search for other peoples components or functions before going ahead or writing our own or 
 refactoring someone elses. This allowed us to work a lot faster, as there was less disagreements and less merge conflicts. This could also be put down to the 
 fact that our structure was well set up so these processes were simplified. If we did have questions about each others implementations, we were able to resolve 
 them quicker than last week.This was likely due to us becoming more familiar with each others code styles and better leveraging JIRA to work out who is currently 
 working on what task so we know who to ask for when we have issues.

What was not finished
 - The only thing this sprint we didn’t finish was the update eatery profile. This was primarily due to us kind of forgetting about implementing it frontend. The backend endpoint is complete for it and the structure is created as a component in the frontend. We will ensure this doesn’t affect the success of the project by quickly resolving the issue early in the next sprint

What is planned for next sprint
 - Next sprint we aim to complete the voucher functionality of our application as well as resolve the story we did not finish in sprint 2.

Week 6
What was planned for the period since the last work diary
 - Last week, our plan was to finish most of the functionality associated with creating and booking vouchers. We also planned to finish off edit eatery profile which we didn't quite get
 around to finishing last week

What was finished
 - We were able to successfully complete our sprint with plenty of time to spare. Whilst their was quite a lot to do it was managable as everyone worked consistently 
 throughout the week. Everyone also had more time than normal as a result  of flex week. I in particular focused on implementing the frontend of the voucher 
 components from the eatery perspective. This involved primarily creating, editing and deleting vouchers. This with any other feature required close communication with 
 the backend in order to ensure that endpoints were being called in the right way to receieve the data how we need it. I also made a template for the redeem voucher page
 so that feature will be easier to implement next sprint. Additionally, Ash was able to finish of the edit eatery profile page reusing the register form component to make
 that section of code functionally decomposed and easy to work with.

What were the main technical and non technical obstacles and how they were overcome
 - One of the main challenges that arose this week was the maven seemingly out of the blue stopped compiling, meaning our backend could not be run. This happened towards the end of the
 week and was a major source of stress for me in particular, as I believe I was the first to encounter it. After alot of trial and error experimenting with different possible resolution options
 for approximately 4-5 hours, it turned out to be an issue with the parent pom that our spring application was being built from. Once I discovered that, I attempted rolling back to a previous version
 and thankfully that worked. This was quite a difficult task, as alot of the resources online were not particularly clear or did not match up with the issue I was facing. 
 - We did not have any non technical obstacles, as we worked well as a team, making use of the feedback we gave each other from the retrospective we completed including improving our branch
 names, leveraging each others code wherever possible and communicating our plans effectively (with endpoint tables and better use of JIRA).

What was not finished
 - This week, we were able to finish everything that we planned to do/

What is planned for next sprint
 - Next sprint we aim to complete the redeem functionality and additional diner voucher features.

Week 7
What was planned for the period since the last work diary
 - Since last week, we planned to implement the voucher functionality which included the ability for vouchers that have been bought to be 
redeemed.

What was finished
 - We again were able to complete this sprint with plenty of time to spare. As a result, we used this time to rework the design for the 
frontend as well as fix some bugs that had been identified throughout the implementation process. 
 - An example of an improvement made was better handling of invalid tokens, automatically logging the user out if they are on a page unauthorised. Furthermore, the display 
on some of the dates were incorrect, so I made sure that the format made sense and was easy for users to understand. 
 - I also added in some mobile responsiveness, so our application looks aesthetically pleasing on both large and small screen sizes. 
 We also started working on some of the search functionality that we originally had planned for the next sprint, but since we finished so early, it 
made sense to get a head start on it.
 - I also added some UX features such as load spinners, so users have a better understanding of whether something is going wrong or if what
 they are experiencing is the expected behaviour of the application.

What were the main technical and non technical obstacles and how they were overcome
 - Everything this week went very smoothly, we all worked together well and we had completed alot of this sprints functionality in the sprint prior
 hence, we were able to clean up and then polish our application which was great.
 - A technical obstable that we are beginning to face is not having yet implemented any tests for our project. Whilst when our application was small
 a quick run through of the happy path along with backend API testing with ARC/Postman was sufficient to gauge whether the application was working.
 - However, with so much functionality now implemented into the application, it is becoming very time consuming to run through all edge cases to make sure
 our changes haven't messed anything up. If small problems have arised in the past, we have been able to identify and go to the person in the team who can 
 assist us with that problem. However, to catch all of the issues more efficiently, having an extensive testing suite would be much more efficient.
 - As a result, we plan on beginning writing tests in the coming weeks to ensure the correctness of our application.

What is planned for next sprint
 - Next sprint will be our last real application functionality sprint. In this our plan is to implement the recommendation algorithm and the search functionality
 parts of the application. This will definitely be challenging, and we will ensure that everyone is active and working consistently throughout the next week in order to 
 get everything done. However, as a result of having already started on some of the implementation, we should hopefully be able to finish all user stories by next Sunday.
