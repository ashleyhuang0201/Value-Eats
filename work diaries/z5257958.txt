Week 1
 - Formed our group, set up our team JIRA, google doc and github repository with the team.
 - Writing up an initial draft for the background of our project, identifying the problems our app is 
   aiming to resolve as well as conducting market research into the flaws that other competitors in the 
   same industry with their applications so we can be ensuring people want to make use of our software over competitors.
 - Furthermore, I helped with finalising the storyboards, changing the UI elements in a few places to make the 
   application flow, feel intuitive and adhere to standard UI/UX principles. Specifically, made the deletion of 
   eatery discounts more intuitive and informed that the user confirms upon clicking the button which performs the action, as it is an important action. Also added the screen which shows the user their code after they have booked in a discount code. The screen includes both the discount code and the amount of time that they have left to use it.
 - Met up with the group on Sunday night to finalise the story boards and check in on everyone’s progress, 
   as well as discussing the plans for the upcoming week.

Week 2
 - This week our groups focus was primarily on user stories 
 - I set up the initial drafts for our epics and confirmed that everyone was okay with them in the tutorial. From there, we could then categorize the user stories that other people had made
 into the correct epic category
 - I helped add in some additional user stories for some of the elements in our application that were initially missed, such as the stories for users personal voucher viewing
 - As I wrote user stories, in some cases, it required a minor reshift of the way our storyboards were structured. If this was the case, the changes were also reflected.
 - Also wrote up acceptance criteria for all of our user stories so the specific details of what needs to be accomplished from each particular story is clear.
 - After this, we met on Sunday at 5pm as a group in order to transfer our user stories to JIRA and work out which of those stories would be completed in the first sprint.
 We discussed this as a team as we will be using JIRA extensively throughout the rest of the project, so it is important for everyone to know where everything is.
 - I also made sure that we put some protocols in place for dealing with code, for example, when implementing a feature, we will write it on it's own feature branch, which will be
 merged back into the master branch once it has been finished with a pull request, which will have to be reviewed by a certain number of people on the team (probably only 1), before it is approved to 
 go back into master.
 - The other main item that I worked on this week was the initial construction of the system architecture diagram. On the meeting on Sunday that went from 5pm - 8pm, 
 I created a draft for our system architecture diagram, adding in images and connections between the components. For our frontend and backend, we will be using 
 Java SpringBoot and React as these are the technologies that we as a team are most familiar with.
 - Next week, I plan to finalise the proposal and format it nicely so it is ready for submission. We will meet on Wednesday and potentially more throughout the week to ensure that 
 everything is done to the highest standard.

Week 3
 - This week, we mainly were polishing all aspects of our report so get it ready for submitting on Sunday night.
 - Throughout the week, I finished refining the user stories to ensure the epics were general enough to classify all the user stories attached correctly. I also added a second system architecture diagram which is more
 focused on the specific entities that will need to be implemented for our solution, not just the technologies. Furthermore, I also assisted with cleaning up the proposal document to make
 remove some of the unnecessary paragraphs as well as refining some of the wording used throughout.
 - Next week, we will begin work on the first sprint, were we will aim to set up authentication. We will have a team meeting to work out how to divide the work amongst our group so we
 can work as efficiently as possible.

Week 4
 - Focused on completing our first sprint - which ends Sunday 27/6/2021 11:30. 
 - I made the initial frontend draft of what our login page was going to look like and this allowed for other team members to follow along using the same visual style
 - Furthermore, I connected the backend that was written to register and log in diners to the frontend
 - I had some issues with getting CORS to work, but it turned out to be a simple one-line command that was annotated on the authentication controller
 - Set up the method in which our backend will return information with a response backend service, which will ensure that responses are returned with a HTTP response code along
 with a message describing what happened and optionally some corresponding data.
 - Also set up the method in which our frontend will display information to users. It uses material UI components called snack bars, which are brief closable messages that appear
 at the bottom of the screen and will automatically disappear after a set amount of time.
 - Furthermore, I constructued the frontend for our landing pages making use of a component for a nav bar that Oscar had previously made. Then I connected the frontend to the backend logic
 to finish the logout feature, after making some backend changes to parts that were not working.

Week 5
What was planned for the period since the last work diary
 - Our plan since the period were to complete the diner functionality portion of the program, allowing diners to 
interact with restaurants, write reviews for them, edit and delete their own reviews as well as update their profiles.

What was finished
 - We successfully completed the sprint within the allocated timeframe. This involved completion of both the frontend 
and backend for all of the features described. This sprint, the frontend was a lot of work than the backend, as opposed 
to last time where the opposite was true. The fontend creation involved the styling and integration of 3 brand new pages. 
I focused primarily on the frontend, specifically handling the creation, editing and deletion of reviews as well as allowing 
the diner to update their profile.

What were the main technical and non technical obstacles and how they were overcome
 - This sprint went a lot smoother than the previous, and this was as a result of two factors. After the demonstration, we conducted our retrospective where 
 we discussed what we could do to improve our workflow. Whilst many useful things came from this such as the importance of good branch naming conventions the 
 most important one that increased the speed of workflow was the separation of tasks such that they did not overlap and working with not against each others code. 
 As a result, we did a lot less refactoring and consciously tried to search for other peoples components or functions before going ahead or writing our own or 
 refactoring someone elses. This allowed us to work a lot faster, as there was less disagreements and less merge conflicts. This could also be put down to the 
 fact that our structure was well set up so these processes were simplified. If we did have questions about each others implementations, we were able to resolve 
 them quicker than last week.This was likely due to us becoming more familiar with each others code styles and better leveraging JIRA to work out who is currently 
 working on what task so we know who to ask for when we have issues.

What was not finished
 - The only thing this sprint we didn’t finish was the update eatery profile. This was primarily due to us kind of forgetting about implementing it frontend. The backend endpoint is complete for it and the structure is created as a component in the frontend. We will ensure this doesn’t affect the success of the project by quickly resolving the issue early in the next sprint

What is planned for next sprint
 - Next sprint we aim to complete the voucher functionality of our application as well as resolve the story we did not finish in sprint 2.
