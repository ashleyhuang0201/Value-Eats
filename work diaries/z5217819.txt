Week 1
- In week 1, we formed our groups and set-up our JIRA and GitHub accounts.
- We have also created a Google Docs where we have written up the background of our project proposal.
- We have made significant progress on the storyboards using Balsamiq, mapping out what we'd like the user interface to look like, taking in consideration of design principles for better user experience.
- We had a team meeting on Sunday night to talk about our current progress, and also improved on our existing work together.
- We plan to polish up the storyboards next week as well as start on the following sections of the proposal.

Week 2
- This week, we mostly finished with our user stories.
- During our lab in week 2, we've made significant progress, writing up acceptance criterias for each user stories.
- Initially, I had written up some user stories, which we then later categorised into epics in our week 2 lab, and also added them into our JIRA. We added story points to each user story in JIRA.
- We have also decided on using Spring Boot, React and SQLite3 for this project.
- We have finalised our storyboard, made some minor touches on areas where we have missed as we were writing user stories.
- We made a start to the system architecture diagram which we would finish by the end of week 3.
- Overall, there weren't many issues - all issues were able to be resolved easily.
- In week 3, I plan to polish up our entire proposal and have it ready before our next meeting.
