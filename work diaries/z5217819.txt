Week 1
- In week 1, we formed our groups and set-up our JIRA and GitHub accounts.
- We have also created a Google Docs where we have written up the background of our project proposal.
- We have made significant progress on the storyboards using Balsamiq, mapping out what we'd like the user interface to look like, taking in consideration of design principles for better user experience.
- We had a team meeting on Sunday night to talk about our current progress, and also improved on our existing work together.
- We plan to polish up the storyboards next week as well as start on the following sections of the proposal (user stories, etc.).

Week 2
- This week, we mostly finished with our user stories.
- During our lab in week 2, we've made significant progress, writing up acceptance criterias for each user stories.
- Initially, I had written up some user stories, which we then later categorised into epics in our week 2 lab, and have also added them into our JIRA. We added story points to each user story in JIRA.
- We have also decided on using Spring Boot, React and SQLite3 for this project.
- We have finalised our storyboard, made some minor touches on areas where we have missed as we were writing user stories.
- We made a start to the system architecture diagram which we would finish by the end of week 3.
- Overall, there weren't many issues - all issues were able to be resolved easily.
- In week 3, I plan to polish up our entire proposal and have it ready before our next meeting.

Week 3
- This week we have got every section required into our proposal.
- I added a table which demonstrated how our user stories had covered each project objective.
- We have written up the novel functionalities our system will provide.
- As determining if each user story is covered in our storyboards may be quite challenging, we have decided to create a table that states the relevant user stories in each storyboard frame.
- We have finalised the system architecture diagrams and storyboards that we worked on last week.
- We have also decided to write up the system architecture descriptions as we believed that it would make things clearer.
- I have assisted in finalising the proposal ensuring that every section meets the criteria.
- In week 4, we plan to begin our first sprint for our project. We plan to implement the authentication features of our system.
